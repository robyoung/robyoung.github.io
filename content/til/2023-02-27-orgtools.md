I use manage all my tasks and notes in [org files](https://orgmode.org/) using [nvim-orgmode](https://github.com/nvim-orgmode/orgmode).
There are some things I'd like to do with them that is not easy with nvim-orgmode so I decided to start
writing some tools to work with them.

## Count close

My first little tool, mostly just to experiment is [`count_close.py`](https://github.com/robyoung/orgtools/blob/main/count_close.py). It draws simple terminal histograms of tasks closed by time period. Below is a snippet showing tasks closed by day.

```bash
> python count_close.py week
2022-01-03    2  ==
2022-01-10    0
2022-01-17    0
2022-01-31    1  =
...
2023-01-30   16  ================
2023-02-06    8  ========
2023-02-13   13  =============
2023-02-20   13  =============
```

## Next steps

The next thing I'd like to do is sync some of my calendars with my org files so that I get the notifications about tasks
and events in one place.
