This is the first of my week notes. They follow the tech stuff I have been doing
outside of work. These week notes are primarily to help me keep track of what
I have been working on. I'm publishing them to encourage me to do it more regularly.
If you are not me they will probably be really boring for you. Sorry.

So, what have I been up to this last week?

## A new website

The biggest thing that has happened this week is that I have rebuilt my website.
Rob Young Digital is no longer a company so this can now be my personal site. Which
basically means a blog.

I’ve moved from [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/)
and so far I am absolutely loving it. Everything just works straight out of the box.
It’s so easy I didn’t even bother with a theme, hence the rather minimal design.

I’ve moved from self hosted to GitHub Pages and so far I am absolutely loving it.
I just push to a branch and GitHub does the rest.

The repo is hosted at [github.com/robyoung/robyoung.github.io](https://www.github.com/robyoung/robyoung.github.io)

## A new blog post

One reason for rebuilding my site was because I have shut my company down. Another
reason is that I have an idea for a blog post (or series of blog posts, depending
on how big it gets).

Over the last few months I have been learning embedded programming with Rust. I had
a couple of false starts and found some things pretty tough. So this week I have
started planning out a post on things I wish I had known when starting out in embedded
Rust.

## Documentation fixes

Finally, while doing some research for the blog post I made some minor improvements to embedded Rust docs.

- [rust-embedded/embedonomicon#72](https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedonomicon/pull/72) - Switch to using GitHub Actions for CI
- [rust-embedded/embedonomicon#70](https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedonomicon/pull/70) - Grammar fixes
- [japaric/volatile-register#11](https://github.com/japaric/volatile-register/pull/11) - Add cortex-m targets to docs.rs
