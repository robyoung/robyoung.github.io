<h1>This Week: 1</h1>

<time class="title" datetime="2021-08-08"> 8 August 2021</time>

<p>This is the first of my week notes. They follow the tech stuff I have been doing
outside of work. These week notes are primarily to help me keep track of what
I have been working on. I'm publishing them to encourage me to do it more regularly.
If you are not me they will probably be really boring for you. Sorry.</p>
<p>So, what have I been up to this last week?</p>
<h2 id="a-new-website">A new website</h2>
<p>The biggest thing that has happened this week is that I have rebuilt my website.
Rob Young Digital is no longer a company so this can now be my personal site. Which
basically means a blog.</p>
<p>I’ve moved from <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to <a href="https://www.getzola.org/">Zola</a>
and so far I am absolutely loving it. Everything just works straight out of the box.
It’s so easy I didn’t even bother with a theme, hence the rather minimal design.</p>
<p>I’ve moved from self hosted to GitHub Pages and so far I am absolutely loving it.
I just push to a branch and GitHub does the rest.</p>
<p>The repo is hosted at <a href="https://www.github.com/robyoung/robyoung.github.io">github.com/robyoung/robyoung.github.io</a></p>
<h2 id="a-new-blog-post">A new blog post</h2>
<p>One reason for rebuilding my site was because I have shut my company down. Another
reason is that I have an idea for a blog post (or series of blog posts, depending
on how big it gets).</p>
<p>Over the last few months I have been learning embedded programming with Rust. I had
a couple of false starts and found some things pretty tough. So this week I have
started planning out a post on things I wish I had known when starting out in embedded
Rust.</p>
<h2 id="documentation-fixes">Documentation fixes</h2>
<p>Finally, while doing some research for the blog post I made some minor improvements to embedded Rust docs.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedonomicon/pull/72">rust-embedded/embedonomicon#72</a> - Switch to using GitHub Actions for CI</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedonomicon/pull/70">rust-embedded/embedonomicon#70</a> - Grammar fixes</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/japaric/volatile-register/pull/11">japaric/volatile-register#11</a> - Add cortex-m targets to docs.rs</li>
</ul>
